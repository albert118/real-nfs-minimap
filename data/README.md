# Data (Sources)

Original data for speed cameras from a independently maintained Facebook MyMaps page [here](tinyurl.com/SpeedCamerasNSW), and the Facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/SpeedCamerasNSW/?checkpoint_src=any).

- Converted that KMZ (aka. KML) to CSV using this tool.
- KMZ can be opened by first changing the file type to ZIP then browsing the internal files (incl. `doc.kml`)
